I want you to build a SaaS web application designed for pregnant women and new mothers to track and log their pregnancy journey and the first 5 years of their baby's life. The app must be fully functional with a freemium business model, secure user authentication, and data storage that is GDPR compliant. The app should be polished enough to serve as a solid MVP and be scalable in future.

Project Overview:
Target users: Pregnant women and mothers of babies/toddlers (0–5 years).

Purpose: Track and store key data and memories from pregnancy and early childhood.

Business model: Freemium, with premium features locked behind a one-time payment.

Core Features (Free Tier):
Secure Signup/Login

Email + password authentication

Up to 4 users per account (e.g., mother, partner, grandparents)

GDPR-compliant data handling

Pregnancy & Baby Tracker

Pregnancy journal by week

Symptom tracking

Ultrasound/milestone photo uploads (up to 5 in free tier)

Baby profile (name, birthday, weight, etc.)

Track baby’s:

First words

First steps

First teeth

Height/weight over time

Medical appointments

Vaccination history

Sleeping, feeding, and growth milestones

Appointments & Milestones

Calendar integration (internal calendar is fine for MVP)

Create/edit/delete appointments and reminders

Upcoming milestone alerts

Premium Features (One-Time Payment Unlock):
Memory Logging

Upload unlimited photos with titles and comments

Tag entries by event/theme (e.g., Christmas, Summer, Birthday)

Monthly "Highlight Reel"

Auto-generated summary of the month’s positive logs, photos, and events

User option to enable/disable

Multi-Child Support

Add and manage profiles for multiple children (only one child allowed in free tier)

Downloadable Baby Book / Timeline

Export baby’s journey and memories into a beautiful, printable PDF

Priority Support & Early Access

Faster help and testing of new features

Additional Technical Requirements:
GDPR compliance: Store data securely with user consent management.

Encryption: Encrypt sensitive user and baby data in storage and transit.

Database: Use PostgreSQL (or Firebase if easier) to store user data and media references.

Frontend: Clean, modern UI with mobile responsiveness (React or Next.js preferred).

Backend: Node.js or Python Flask preferred (but use what’s most compatible with Replit).

File storage: Use cloud-based storage (e.g., Firebase Storage or Supabase) for secure image upload.

UX Design:
Clean dashboard with sections: Pregnancy, Baby, Milestones, Appointments

Onboarding flow explaining how to use each section

Settings toggle to enable/disable features like the monthly highlight

Role-based access for 4 users per account (all can contribute)

Deliverables:
Fully functional MVP hosted on Replit with secure auth

Freemium and premium functionality clearly separated

Placeholder UI for payment modal (no payment integration needed yet)

README with setup instructions and user guide

Clean, well-documented code for easy future development

Start by scaffolding the project structure, creating the authentication system, and building out the pregnancy tracker module. Then implement the appointment tracking feature, followed by the premium memory logging and highlight reel.
