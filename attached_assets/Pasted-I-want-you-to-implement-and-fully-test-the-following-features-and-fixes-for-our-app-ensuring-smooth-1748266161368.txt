I want you to implement and fully test the following features and fixes for our app, ensuring smooth UX/UI, complete backend integration, and bug-free operation. Plan and execute everything carefully, test and debug thoroughly, and do not stop until every item below is fully complete, functional, and error-free:
1. Post-Registration Pop-Up

    After a user registers, show a pop-up with two buttons:

        “Are you pregnant?”

        “Add a child”

    Each button should take the user immediately to the relevant “Add” pop-up, skipping menus or extra steps.

2. Tutorial for New Mothers

    After a baby/child is added, show a tutorial introducing all base (free) features.

    Allow the mother to click into each feature individually.

    Personalize the tutorial based on her situation (e.g., pregnancy vs. baby stage), so only relevant features are shown.

3. Highlight Premium Features

    After the tutorial, show a pop-up highlighting Premium features, with clear visuals and benefits.

4. Premium Payment Integration

    Set up a payment system for upgrading to Premium Lifetime Access.

    Price: €28 one-time payment.

    Use a secure, GDPR-compliant provider like Stripe or Paddle.

5. Fix and Improve the Following Issues

    “Save Symptom” button is not working — fix it.

    When a milestone is saved, it currently does not display anywhere — fix this so it appears in all appropriate locations (timeline, reports, overview pages, etc.).

6. Confirm Implementation of These Features

Ensure the following features are completely built, working, and integrated:

    Fetal Development Tracking

    Feeding Log

    Sleep Tracker

    Diaper Log

    Health Records

    Private Family Group feature allowing users to invite and manage trusted family members (e.g., grandparents, uncles, aunts), who can view and/or contribute to child data.

7. Login Modes

Add two distinct login modes on the login screen:
Mother Login:

    Full access to all features based on pregnancy or baby/child stage.

Family Login:

    Users in this mode should have access to the following:

        Timeline view showing:

            Uploaded photos

            Saved milestones

        Access to:

            Baby pool

            Registry list of items

            Name suggestion page

        If the family member is tagged as the mother’s husband/partner, they should also have access to the Cravings page.

Ensure permissions and content are tailored to their role and access level.
8. Complete Testing & Debugging

    Test every interface, display, button, link, pop-up, and database connection.

    Ensure every feature is:

        Displayed in the correct place

        Fully functional across platforms

        Bug-free and stable

    Do not leave any part untested.

Final Instructions

    Plan every step in detail to avoid bugs, delays, or missing logic.

    Test everything end-to-end before considering anything complete.

    You are responsible for ensuring every feature and fix works flawlessly. Do not leave this to me.

    If anything is unclear, list all your questions together at the end.
